# Rust-on-Arduino
## Overview

This Project is a demonstration of a basic setup for how to program an Arduino Uno with Rust, rather than some of the more common alternatives, such as with C/C++

This project demonstrates some basic Arduino Functionality, as well as takes advantage of tools to integrate a Rust development environment into the Arduino Ecosystem.
